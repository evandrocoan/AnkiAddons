## Automatic Card Creation

Right-click either on the **Expression** field or the **Meaning** field to automatically create your Japanese flashcard with the information from <a href="http://jisho.org" rel="nofollow">jisho.org</a>.
If your Japanese note types have a **Sound** field configured the **Jisho Support Add-on** will even download the audio file automatically.
Note: audio files will be stored in your anki media collection.
