# Source Siblings Bury Reschedule

Addon for scheduler V2 for now. If requested may be added to reschedule V3 or FSRS.
Sadly only works for Desktop but not Android or Anki Web.

If a card has the field `Source`,
them any card which also has a `Source` field and is scheduled for today,
is buried and rescheduled for the next 1 up to 7 days.

If a card has the field `Sibling`,
them any card which also has a `Sibling` field and is scheduled for today,
is buried and rescheduled for the next 2 up to 8 days.
